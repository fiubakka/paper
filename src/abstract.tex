\noindent This project aims to validate a \textit{proof of concept} for a distributed game server architecture, featuring high horizontal scalability, elasticity, and fault tolerance. We will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed architecture compared to the alternative of a monolithic server and evaluate its performance based on our developed game.

This report is composed of two main sections. First, we present, explain, and analyze the designed and developed architecture for the game server. This architecture is based on the use of Akka, a toolkit for developing concurrent and distributed applications based on the actor model. Various performance tests will also be conducted under different conditions, measuring the consumed resources in each case.

Secondly, we will present how we integrated this server with our client developed in Godot, an open-source game engine created in Argentina.
